# Sudoku-Solver-Nexys
A Sudoku Solver FPGA using the Nexys Video board and outputting to a 1980 x 1080 screen using HDMI.

Hi, I am only uploading some of the files for the time being. When I get further along in this project I will add in the full folder structure generated by Vivado

I know I could put the actual solving in C in the SDK and use the microblaze, but I want a challenge by coding in a non-OOP language. Making a C version is probably next.

I am thinking of making a block that always streams the working register and the x and y count out so that the user can see what the solver is trying. But first I got to make the solver work.
